  After far too long between, Iâ€™ve finally had a chance to release a new version of SchemaPuker

This release contains the following changes;

* Objects are now shown with both their label and API name in the select list, entering objects in the text box is still done by API name only as before.
![](/img/0*4p6kLgVUK0nLjndq.png)* An issue with some custom object relationships not being drawn has now been resolved
* Error handling has been further enhanced
It is live now at: <https://schemapuker.herokuapp.com>, so please give it a go!
