  ![](/img/0*oYva0Kadm4otSzG1.jpg)As you may (or may not be…) aware I am part of the team organising [Surf Force](https://www.surfforce.co).

**What is Surf Force you ask?**

Well it’s a salesforce community event, but not like any other that you may have been to. Through surfing, we encourage you to take a chance and to step out of your comfort zone.

Surfing is something that not a lot of people have done, and that people might find scary or challenging… But when you have people around you who are there to guild you and help, you will realise it wasn’t so hard after all.

This is a lesson that we can apply to the salesforce community, and the community at large. We can all step out of our comfort zones, learn something new, do something great, and help others. Surf Force is here to prove this to you, teach you new things and empower you to do this.

![](/img/0*_z0qUvH86GhthgGY.jpg)I helped with Surf Force in 2016 (Which was held in Aberavon, Wales) and loved the concept and what the founder, [Shaun Holmes](https://twitter.com/ShaunHolmless) was trying to achieve. Shaun’s enthusiasm for the event, and helping others was inspiring and I knew that in 2017 that I had to be part of it and help to make it bigger and better!

**Organising Surf Force 2017**

Organising an event takes a lot of hard work, even more so when everyone has day jobs and their own lives to live. All of the team work full time and have varying family and other commitments, and to make things even more challenging, we are holding the event in a different country!

To spite the challenges, the team of [Shaun Holmes](https://twitter.com/ShaunHolmless), [Kerry Townsend](https://twitter.com/KerryTownsend), [Scott Gassmann](https://twitter.com/scottgassmann), [Jenny Bamber](https://twitter.com/Jenny_Bamber), [Lauren Touyet](https://twitter.com/LaurenTouyet) and [myself](https://twitter.com/mickwheelz_) have made amazing progress on making Surf Force and we had our first trip to Bundoran, Ireland to scope out the venue for this years event, talk to local contacts and charities and, of course, go for a surf!

If you’ve never been to [Bundoran](http://discoverbundoran.com/) (or to Ireland in general) then you are missing out, it is an absolutely gorgeous place and the people there are incredibly friendly.

![](/img/0*TXdiKs9sVYKwjoG5.jpg)The venue we have chosen for Surf Force 2017 is the [Great Northern Hotel](http://www.greatnorthernhotel.com/), which is right on the beach had has some excellent facilities for the event, as well as for leisure (pool, spa, sauna, golf course, etc)

![](/img/0*bgloveHFrxfS0Xr9.jpg)We also met up with the amazing people at the [Donegal Adventure Centre](https://twitter.com/dacsurf), who will be providing the surfing lessons and all of the kit required. The organises and instructors there are amazing and really make sure that you are both having a good time, learning and being safe.

![](/img/0*gqWI0CeOFtVtuxvA.jpg)I am very excited to be a part of this event and to work with the amazing group of people who are organising it and I hope that you all will come along. I also wish to thank our sponsors, who help to make events like this possible. So please check out [Taskfeed](https://www.taskfeedapp.com/) and [Good Day Sir!](http://www.gooddaysirpodcast.com/)
