title:	"‚Ä¶and now for no reason: Emoji‚Äôs in your Wi-Fi name!"

A while ago, I came across someone using emoji as a Wi-Fi network name (SSID), I tried to do the same on my wifi router (I wanted the delightful smiling poo emoji üí©) but my router, sadly wouldn‚Äôt let me.

I saw it again the other day, and I thought I‚Äôd have another try, after all this was years ago and I have a much newer router, and newer version of DD-WRT running on it.

But, I was rudely told that what I was trying to do was illegal.

![](/img/0*36s-ge9mATw_oXVq.png)Inserting the emoji returned ‚Äúp)‚Äù which was not accepted, I did also try the unicode char for it ‚Äú[U+1F4A9](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/unicode/inspect/hex/1F4A9)‚Äù but that didn‚Äôt work either.

Turning to google, I wondered if anyone had done this successfully before, but all I could find was [this](https://medium.com/@bcjordan/emojify-your-wi-fi-c01f4ac0b0ab) article, This was done on the same model of wireless router as I own, but using the stock firmware.

But it did give me a good idea‚Ä¶ So taking the same approach as in the article, but skipping straight to the server-side method, I used chrome dev tools to inspect the request;

So far I‚Äôve not had any issues with modern-ish devices finding/connecting to it, however I did leave the 2.4ghz radio of my wireless router alone, so that older devices can use it if need be.
