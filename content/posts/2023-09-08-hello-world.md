Hi Everyone,

Today is my 35th Birthday and normally, this would be just another day for me… I was never really one for celebrating. 

However, this time it is different…

Because today, I am ready to introduce myself to you all. My name is Sophie, I am a transgender woman, and I am happy.

Quite a while ago now, I was able to come to terms with being trans. It is something that has been with me in one form or another, for as long as I can remember, and around a year ago I began to tell family and close friends.

I have sought the appropriate care and started my medical transition around six months ago.

This period has been the happiest and most fulfilling time of my entire life. I am truly thankful for the wonderful people I have surrounded myself with, who have given me nothing but love and acceptance.

I know that this may come as a shock to some of you, and I am sure many of you will have questions. I am more than happy to answer anything asked in good faith, so please feel free to send me a private message.

Much Love
Sophie
