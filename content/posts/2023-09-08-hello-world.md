Hi Everyone,

Today is my 35th Birthday and normally, this would be just another day for me… I was never really one for celebrating. 

However, this time it is different…

Because today, I am ready to introduce myself to you all. My name is Sophie, I am a transgender woman, and I am **happy**.

Quite a while ago now, I was able to come to terms with being trans. It is something that has been with me in one form or another, for as long as I can remember.

Around a year ago I began to tell family and close friends, and take steps to begin my transition. I have sought the appropriate medical care and began my medical transition around six months ago.

This period has been the happiest and most fulfilling time of my entire life. I am truly thankful for the wonderful people I have surrounded myself with, who have given me nothing but love and acceptance.

Much Love,

Sophie
